###Week 0

 I have enlisted in an intensive RubyonRails programming bootcamp.  Here is my thought process as I go through these six months in sunny Denver, Colorado. 

 I never thought that I would become a computer nerd, but I am really enjoying all of the new programs, people and ideas that is coming out of learning more about programming.  

 We completed three main tutorials: [Ruby in 100 minutes], [Event Manager], and [Encryptor].  These all reviewed the basics of Ruby syntax and terms.  

[Ruby in 100 minutes]: Teaches us the basics of Ruby-- mainly individual objects (strings, integars, floats, boolean variables, etc), the two categories of grouped objects (hashes and arrays), arguments, paramaters, methods and instances.  An instance is essentially a specific object in a class, while an arguement is a way to manipulate the method.  You can apply certain methods to it if you define those in your code.

[Event Manager]:  Teaches you how to organize and select columns in csv files.  Quite similar to attribute tabel organization in gis.  Also gets you to learn how to organize and edit data so that it is cleaner and more consistant.  With all the mapping projects I have particpated in, this is super important to me.  I am so anal about making sure that keys and values are consistant and organized well because further down the line it become a pain in the ass having to reorganize all of that information.  It basically blocks you from being able to create sexy maps in a short time.  You have to spend time reformatting the map content instead of formatting the cartographic features.   

[Encryptor]: Provides foundation for password encrypting and decrypting.  Good ways to learn how to create better security and learn how to hack into accounts by using computers loops.  The guide was thorough; however, once in a while it would have you do some things that you never knew existed (i.e. invert, which switches the key and value attributes).

Today, we learned about open source and licensing.  It was a bit of a review, but it is useful to learn about all of the licensing issues.  I think MIT licensing makes the most sense to me. 

I feel pretty good about playing around with git and bash code. 

Questions that came up include yaml files, how to memorize syntax, why there are certain brackets used, etc.

I still really want to learn vim-- so that I can be speedier on my computer.  I still am inching to learn more about javascript so that I can develop some more mapping tools.   Once I am more familiar with Ruby then I will be able to understand the basic concepts of Javascript and be on my way to creating cooler map plugins and programs.  In two years, I would like to be the ultimate mapping queen....
