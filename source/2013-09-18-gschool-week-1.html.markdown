"Common Sense is a Myth" (Aral Balkan)

This week we covered some more bash scripting (personalizing terminal and bash profile), reviewed fundamental concepts, minitesting and reviewng bugs.  We dabbled in [pry], which is an IRB alternative for reviewing your code.  

Going in and out of directories in the terminal is very important to do fast.  Knowing shortcuts, or vim, is quite useful for being able to speed up Changing settings, add background colors, font colors and different fonts are all important.

"Don't worry about what the database schems should look like... great design is your business plan"

Simplify.  Design thinking must trickle down.

Always remember to initialize.  You probably need to create a parameter off of initialize, but you don't always have to use it. 

There are two different schools of thought of testing.  Cheat and write a new test that will force you to test it.  Or don't do the redundant extra test and refactor it to make a rugged test. 

Different learning styles require difference types of methods for attacking code.  The JumpStart Lab path is to load hefty tutorials at students and make them write code from the beginning.  Yikes!
