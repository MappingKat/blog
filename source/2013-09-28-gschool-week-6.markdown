##Focus Week and Lightning Talks

Feeling overwhelmed.  Best works when I am one on one with someone that knows what they are talking about.  This week I have been a little lost in trying to find that guidance.  

I def think that in the long run I will be able to code and create fantastic databases, but right now I am a little caught up in trying to learn Ruby as best as I can. 


I also am behind on publishing my Heroku app... meh. 

[insert prezi]

This week I was assigned to create a lightning talk on open source leaders.  There were many options to chose from, including foudners of Oracle, Linux, 

I chose Frank Warmerdam.  I did not know much about him until I did a little research.  It is crazy how much he actually contributed to making the mapping world a little but easier.
