##IdeaBox and Code Retreat

Last week, we worked on a project called IdeaBox.  This project taught us about how to build web applications, namely Sinatra.  While I do feel that I am still a little behind in knowing how to use Ruby and refactor code to the best of my ability, I thought that this project was useful in understanding why we need to learn Ruby.  It connected the web with the previous weeks of learning.  

This project also allowed us to dabble in front-end development a little bit, namely css and html.  

Overall, I enjoyed working on this project; however, I feel that I could have tested the web application part (using Capybara) much better.  This project truly showed me the importance of testing because I would get stuck on little syntax issues and no having a test to figure these issue out beforehand was a pain. 

On Friday, we has a code retreat, which was one of the most useful activities thusfar.  It was nice to be able to sit down without internet and just focus on learning code.  I think I need more of those retreats.
